===================================
MEETING WITH LAURENT-ANKIT 15/3/2017
===================================

* Compiled list was ok. Laurent proposed to add another column "cause".
* Ankit: Calculate "energy" needed to change parameters. (CPU etc.)
* Check out TCP pacing and TOE.
* Laurent: Per-packet load balancing.
* Have to present more concrete measurements.
* Laurent: Check out: reno, newreno, vegas, dctcp for more parameters.
* I have to quantify bare-metal vs VM *relevant* performance.



===================================
MEETING WITH LAURENT-ANKIT 8/3/2017
===================================

* Try to do data analysis on Github to find out parameters that sysadmins often set.
* DO NOT USE Network Simulators. Just use virtualized environments with controlled bandwidth and latency.
* Categorize parameters as to whether they can change on the fly, their impact on performance and whether they are negotiated between the sender and the receiver.
  For example, the window is chosen as the minimum window advertised between the sender and the receiver.
  If one of them has a small fixed window, there is no point in exploring bigger values than this!!
  Also try to separate the parameters.
* Take advantage of Host Tuning Tutorials in order to get a good start to our learning algorithm.
  See if we can beat that with our learning system.
* Using Docker is of no use, since all containers are going to run on the same Host Network Stack (same Kernel).
* I should measure the metrics, not only by issuing elephant flows, but also by issuing many small flows.
* Check out how to set up initial CWND, so that small flows can benefit. (e.g. a 10B flow, with a 10B initial CWND, will finish instantly. With 1B CWN it takes 4RTT's!!)
*?* Keep past settings of flows -> TCP already does that!




==============
OPEN QUESTIONS
==============

* How will we take into account the different network characteristics?
	- Topologies will have to be incorporated into the state!

* Different operating systems have different parameters for TCP. Should we target a specific implementation?

* Every time I have a different TCP congestion algorithm, the set of parameters changes. Should I focus on one only?
  Since we care about the DC environment only, should I stick only to DCTCP or similar?


* ARCHITECTURE:
	- Either distributed agents, each takes their own decisions (Cons: Difficult to get global view)
	- OR: A centralized controller decides based on global metrics and informs the agents on what to change.

* Can iperf really generate representative traffic? How about the ab tool?

* There are some parameters whose impact I cannot check with the simplistic tests I am currently running:
  e.g. : tcp_fack, tcp_early_retrans, tcp_fin_timeout.

  Most of these parameters require many flows, or other environments (e.g. with many losses).


================
CLOSED QUESTIONS
===============

* iperf system - Since we want it to be fast, should I make it compiled rather than scripted?
	- A script will do for now. The time of iperf, ping is dominating anyway.

* I guess we only care for a datacenter, so MTUs and things that TCP was designed for when it began do not matter.
	- YES

* What are our metrics? What do we want to optimize in the end?
	- ANKIT: Mean Flow Completion Time BUT also take into account TPS, latency.

* Time for the sysctls is very small compared to the iperf test time. How should I optimize for performance? Is it worth it to use a compiled C program with libiperf?
	- Answered before. A simple script will do for now.

* For the tests would it be better to use NS-2 instead of real time tests?
  In general virtualization / simulation methods could be preferable because we have
  to tweak kernel parameters.

   -ANKIT: Try both virtualized and non-virtualized methods and compare the relative differences.

* I believe that the network simulator would be a bad idea for our system, since we want to be updating on the fly!!
  -Confirmed at meeting.


* Where will the metrics for our decisions come from? Side-channel measurements or from the live flows themselves? (like PCC)
	- An idea would be that the agents would periodically probe the network and get the performance metrics.
	  ** Confirmed at meeting. Tampering with the existing flows could lead them to low performance-throughput.

* Should I explore the whole parameter space with the script, or cross out some params that seem irrelevant at first?
	- (Laurent) I SHOULD try to cross out some irrelevant parameters at the beginning.
