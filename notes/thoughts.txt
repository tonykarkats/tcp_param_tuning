OPEN QUESTIONS
==============

* Which of the parameters are most important for performance?
	- I am currently going through it in order to try to minimize the parameter space.

* How will we take into account the different network characteristics?
	- Topologies will have to be incorporated into the state!

* Different operating systems have different parameters for TCP. Should we target a specific implementation?

* All the host tuning tutorials are about tuning High BDP networks. :(

CLOSED QUESTIONS
===============

* iperf system - Since we want it to be fast, should I make it compiled rather than scripted?
	- A script will do for now. The time of iperf, ping is dominating anyway.

* I guess we only care for a datacenter, so MTUs and things that TCP was designed for when it began do not matter.
	- YES

* What are our metrics? What do we want to optimize in the end?
	- ANKIT: Mean Flow Completion Time BUT also take into account TPS, latency.

* Time for the sysctls is very small compared to the iperf test time. How should I optimize for performance? Is it worth it to use a compiled C program with libiperf?
	- Answered before. A simple script will do for now.

* For the tests would it be better to use NS-2 instead of real time tests?
  In general virtualization / simulation methods could be preferable because we have
  to tweak kernel parameters.

   -ANKIT: Try both virtualized and non-virtualized methods and compare the relative differences.
