* Which of the parameters are most important for performance?

* iperf system - Since we want it to be fast, should I make it compiled rather than scripted?

* I guess we only care for a datacenter, so MTUs and things that TCP was designed for when it began do not matter.

* What are our metrics? What do we want to optimize in the end?

* Time for the sysctls is very small compared to the iperf test time. How should I optimize for performance? Is it worth it to use a compiled C program with libiperf?
