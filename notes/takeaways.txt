1.TCP RFC (https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc793.txt)
-----------------------------------------------

Tips for performance
    * Small window causes data to be transmitted in many small segments,
      when BETTER performance is achieved with FEWER LARGE segments.
    * Sender can avoid sending small segments by waiting until window is large enough.

2. Improve TCP performance (From Wikipedia)
------------------------------------------

	* TCP timestamps for accurate measurement of RTT
	* TCP window scaling
	* TCP SACK
	* Path MTU discovery to reduce fragmentation overhead

3. Evaluation Criteria for Resource Allocation (Peterson-Davie)
--------------------------------------------------------------

	*Power of the Network = Throughput/Delay
		(-) It assumes M/M/1 queues and a single flow

4. An Experimental Study of the Learnability of Congestion Control
------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Modelling a two-bottleneck network as a single bottleneck hurt performance only mildly.
	* Weak evidence of a tradeoff between link speed operating range and performance.
	* Performance at high degrees of multiplexing may be in opposition with performance when few flows share a bottleneck. --> Prior knowledge of the expected degree of multiplexing over bottleneck links can be very beneficial when designing a congestion control protocol.
	* TCP awareness hurts performance when TCP cross-traffic is absent, but helps dramatically when present.
