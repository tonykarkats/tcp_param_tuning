1.TCP RFC (https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc793.txt)
-----------------------------------------------

Tips for performance
    * Small window causes data to be transmitted in many small segments,
      when BETTER performance is achieved with FEWER LARGE segments.
    * Sender can avoid sending small segments by waiting until window is large enough.

2. Improve TCP performance (From Wikipedia)
------------------------------------------

	* TCP timestamps for accurate measurement of RTT
	* TCP window scaling
	* TCP SACK
	* Path MTU discovery to reduce fragmentation overhead

3. Evaluation Criteria for Resource Allocation (Peterson-Davie)
--------------------------------------------------------------

	*Power of the Network = Throughput/Delay
		(-) It assumes M/M/1 queues and a single flow

4. An Experimental Study of the Learnability of Congestion Control
------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Modelling a two-bottleneck network as a single bottleneck hurt performance only mildly.
	* Weak evidence of a tradeoff between link speed operating range and performance.
	* Performance at high degrees of multiplexing may be in opposition with performance when few flows share a bottleneck. --> Prior knowledge of the expected degree of multiplexing over bottleneck links can be very beneficial when designing a congestion control protocol.
	* TCP awareness hurts performance when TCP cross-traffic is absent, but helps dramatically when present.

5. About the OBJECTIVE FUNCTION
-------------------------------

Alpha fairness metric to evaluate allocations of throughput on shared links.
A flow that receives steady-state throughput of x is assigned a score
U_a(x) = x^(1-a) / (1-a)

Then you try to maximize the sum of the scores

6. DCTCP
--------

	Parameters to configure are:
		* Marking threshold at the switches: K > (C * RTT)/7
		* Estimation gain (weight given to new packets as DCTCP computes alpha:
			g < 1.386 / (sqrt(2*(C * RTT + K)))

	Check out the section 4.3 "Benchmark Traffic" for evaluation using well-known traffic    patterns.
