1.TCP RFC (https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc793.txt)
-----------------------------------------------

Tips for performance
    * Small window causes data to be transmitted in many small segments,
      when BETTER performance is achieved with FEWER LARGE segments.
    * Sender can avoid sending small segments by waiting until window is large enough.

2. Improve TCP performance (From Wikipedia)
------------------------------------------

	* TCP timestamps for accurate measurement of RTT
	* TCP window scaling
	* TCP SACK
	* Path MTU discovery to reduce fragmentation overhead
