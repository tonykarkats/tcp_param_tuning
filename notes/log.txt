16/3
----
* Carried out tests on sender and receiver buffer.
  Did not find out any difference when using parallel streams.
  Of course the maximum sender/receiver window throttles the overall bandwidth.

* Laurent's different TCP implementations that may introduce new parameters.
  - TCP Vegas (for high BDP networks) : NO new parameters introduced.
  - TCP Reno     (Not available on Dryad!)
  - TCP NewReno  (Not available on Dryad!)
  - DCTCP        (Not available on Dryad!)

* PROBLEM: Since we are in a LAN, we will see no queueing. Packets will be delivered immediately.
