# In this experiment we tested the effect of enabling TCP timestamps.
# TCP timestamps may result in better performance for long path netorks and WANs
# since we can measure the RTT more accurately and update the congestion window.
# However they can introduce some processing overhead.

# For the experiment we kept the default dryad parameters and only changed the TCP timestamps option
